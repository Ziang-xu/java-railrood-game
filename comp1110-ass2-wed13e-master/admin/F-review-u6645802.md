Review Comments:

1. he gives all of the possible of the situation of the type, row , column. it is the base of the first setting, and the basis of the next task. it is good.

2.unfortunately, his "if condition" is too long and hard to read, so he should use sever if to segement it and write more notes to help readers to read.
  maybe he can use the case, to instead of if.

3. i think put some details into the tiletye class, it is more essay to read and reuse, like the dice situation. the task 2 is simple so there maybe not different,
 but in the task 6,7,8; put some method in the subclass will be more essay to use and change.
