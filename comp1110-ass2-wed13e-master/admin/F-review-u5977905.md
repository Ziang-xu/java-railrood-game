Review Comments:

1. he create two method getAllpieceA and getAllPieceB. collect piece piece start by A and B. good and clear
2. collect 3 character pieces and try all the pos for this piece. try all the possible, its good
3. use task6 code to check the pieces location whether is valid  use the method before,dont have to over coding, it is good
4. he didn't consider "S" situation
5. dont know why his loop did't work, which can only get one correct piece placement
